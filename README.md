Milestone 1.0
  -  User sign up/sign in
      - We collect their: ID, Name, Last Name, Phone Number, RS username and password, Telegram, Tax number (i think we can ignore this because we can see this on rs.ge)
  -  Authentication via Telegram
  -  Creating profile for user (storing their data in the database)
  -  Monthly alerts for declaration and tax payment
  -  RS API doesn't have automatic declaration and tax payment service, for now we still have to do it manually
